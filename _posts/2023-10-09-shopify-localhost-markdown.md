While Shopify has provided a comprehensive framework that allows developers quickly develop apps using Shopify CLI, it is still not light-weighted in the sense that it has hard dependency on network security tunnels such as Ngrok (which is a long term partner with them), which increases package building time and slows down network communications. It is therefore a frequently asked question to know how to by pass such dependency and/or one of the top feature request to Shopify CLI by developers. In this article, I will talk about technical hacks we used to develop a full-stack Shopify app without using any security tunnel. 

## Assumption
The following steps are largely based on the assumption that the project is generated using Shopify CLI where a full-stack project is contained in a mono-repo that includes both the front and back ends where the back-end synchronously reads a static file from front-end folder in a server-side rendering manner. The back-end is powered by the Express framework in NodeJS and the front-end is developed with React with Vite as the building system. An example project can be found in Shopifyâ€™s official Github repository.

## General Idea
The general idea is to trick `@shopify/shopify-app-express` to believe its deployed in a non-localhost environment with TLS enabled. Thus we can:
1. Alter the DNS entry in the operating system to map a fake domain to localhost.
2. Use local SSL proxy to redirect the traffic from port 443(HTTPS) to back-end server port for request processing.
3. Temporarily allow unauthorized request via TLS. 

## Step by Step Procedure

### Global Local Environment Setup

1. In your local `/etc/hosts` file, add a new line at the bottom:
   ```console
   127.0.0.1 www.fake-shopifytest.com
   ```
       
2. Install `local-ssl-proxy`:
   ```console
   npm install --location=global local-ssl-proxy
   ```

3. Set the following environment variables
    ```console
    export SHOPIFY_API_KEY="Client API KEY"
    export SHOPIFY_API_SECRET="Client Secret"
    export SCOPES=Scopes Required By Your App for OAuth"
    export BACKEND_PORT=3000
    ```

### Shopify App Setup In Partner Portal

1. Change ***App URL*** to be `https://www.fake-shopifytest.com`
2. Change ***Allowed Redirection URLs*** to contain the following entries:
  - `https://www.fake-shopifytest.com/auth/callback`
  - `https://www.fake-shopifytest.com/auth/shopify/callback`
  - `https://www.fake-shopifytest.com/api/auth/callback`

### App Repository Changes

#### Change `vite.config.js` Configuration to Support Hot Module Reloading
In the template app generated by Shopify CLI, `hmrConfig` for non-localhost uses `wss` protocol and `443` for `clientPort`. As now everything is literally going through localhost anyway, change it to the same setting:
```javascript
let hmrConfig;
if (host === "localhost") {
    hmrConfig = {
        protocol: "ws",
        host: "localhost",
        port: 64999,
        clientPort: 64999
    };
} else {
    hmrConfig = {
        protocol: "ws",
        host: "localhost",
        port: 64999,
        clientPort: 64999
    };
}
```

#### Change Hot Module Reloading Configurations 

1. Include **http://localhost:3000** in `dev_embed.js`:
    ```javascript
    import RefreshRuntime from "http://localhost:3000/@react-refresh";
    ```

2. Change `src` entry in `index.html` as follows:
    ```
    <script type="module" src="http://localhost:3000/src/index.jsx"></script>
    ```
    **Note** that for production build this needs be changed back so that the path can be resolved properly.

### Start Hacking

1. Install dependencies:
   ```console
   npm install
   ```

2. Start proxy:
   ```console
   sudo local-ssl-proxy --source 443 --target 3000
   ```

3. Run server in dev mode:
   ```console
   cross-env NODE_ENV=development HOST=https://www.fake-doppio-shopifytest.com NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 nodemon index.js
   ```

4. Run front-end in dev mode:
   ```console
   vite --port 3000
   ```

After the server is spun up, use this URL to install the app on the test store in the browser: <https://www.fake-shopifytest.com/?shop={your-test-store}.myshopify.com>
